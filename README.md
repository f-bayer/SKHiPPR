SKHiPPR [ˈski-pr] is a Python toolbox with focus on **S**tability using the **K**oopman-**Hi**ll **P**rojection method for **P**eriodic solutions and **R**esonance curves.

> SKHiPPR is a continuation toolbox developed by Fabia Bayer as part of a research project in close cooperation with Remco Leine at the Institute for Nonlinear Mechanics, University of Stuttgart, Germany. In this project, we investigate the properties of a Koopman-based Hill stability method for periodic solutions.

The SKHiPPR toolbox is object-oriented and modularized. It generates continuation curves with stability information using an ODE object, Harmonic Balance residual equation, a stability method, and a continuation wrapper.
