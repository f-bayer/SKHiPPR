    Demonstration for creating a simple frequency response curve of a non-autonomous dynamical system with HBM.

    This function performs the following steps:

    #. Creation of :py:class:`~skhippr.Fourier`, :py:class:`~skhippr.solvers.newton.NewtonSolver`, and :py:class:`~skhippr.stability.KoopmmanHillProjection.KoopmanHillSubharmonic` objects to collect method parameters.
    #. Instantiation of a :py:class:`~skhippr.odes.AbstractODE.AbstractODE` (here: :py:class:`~skhippr.odes.nonautonomous.Duffing`) object which contains the ODE.
    #. Setup of an initial guess
    #. Setup and solution of the :py:class:`~skhippr.cycles.hbm.HBMEquation`, which formalizes the Harmonic Balance equations.
    #. Creation of an :py:class:`~skhippr.equations.EquationSystem.EquationSystem` containing only the HBM equations as input to the continuation method.
    #. Continuation of the frequency response curve using :py:func:`~skhippr.cycles.continuation.pseudo_arclength_continuator`and collecting the branch points
    #. Analyzing and plotting the branch points
