    Runs a demonstration of pseudo-arclength continuation for solving a nonlinear problem
    using Newton's method on the circle equation.
    The process includes:

    #. Instantiating a :py:class:`~skhippr.solvers.newton.NewtonSolver` with the solver configuration
    #. Instantiating a :py:class:`~skhippr.equations.Circle.Circle` object which contains the residual
    #. Demonstrating that the :py:class:`~skhippr.solvers.newton.NewtonSolver` can immediately solve the :py:class:`~skhippr.equations.Circle.Circle` for the scalar unknown ``radius``, but not for the array unknown ``y``
    #. Constructing an :py:class:`~skhippr.equations.EquationSystem.EquationSystem` for the unknown ``y`` and using the :py:func:`~skhippr.cycles.continuation.pseudo_arclength_continuator` to iterate along the solution branch.
    #. Constructing another :py:class:`~skhippr.equations.EquationSystem.EquationSystem` by appending a second :py:class:`~skhippr.equations.AbstractEquation.AbstractEquation` subclass and solving it directly for ``y``.
    #. Using the :py:func:`~skhippr.cycles.continuation.pseudo_arclength_continuator` to iterate along the solution branch with the extended :py:class:`~skhippr.equations.EquationSystem.EquationSystem` and the explicit continuation parameter ``theta``
    #. Plotting the results.
